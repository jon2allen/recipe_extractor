### Objectives
- Learn to make crispy fried Yuanxiao.
- Master the technique of preparing and frying Yuanxiao for optimal texture.
- Understand the importance of oil temperature and timing in achieving perfectly fried Yuanxiao.

### Ingredients

- Fresh Yuanxiao (sweet rice balls) - quantity not specified
- Oil for frying - quantity not specified


### Instructions

1.  Ensure the oil temperature is at 50% heat (medium heat).  Too high or too low will result in failure.
2. Gently place the Yuanxiao into the hot oil.
3.  Do not move them immediately.  Once they begin to float, gently tap each Yuanxiao several times against the side of the pan to create cracks in the surface. This prevents them from bursting.
4. Continue frying over low heat until the Yuanxiao float, indicating they are almost cooked.
5. Remove the partially fried Yuanxiao and tap them again to create more cracks.
6. Increase the oil temperature to high heat and return the Yuanxiao to the oil. Fry until golden brown and crispy.  The sugar inside should be visible.
7. Remove the Yuanxiao and drain excess oil.
8. Serve immediately.  The ideal fried Yuanxiao will be slightly flattened and irregularly shaped, with a crispy texture.
