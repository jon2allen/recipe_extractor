### Ingredients

* **For the Dough:**

    * 25g water (水, shuǐ)
    * 228g fire dragon fruit juice (火龙果汁, huǒlóng guǒ zhī)
    * 228g spinach juice (菠菜汁, bōcài zhī):
        * 200g spinach (菠菜, bōcài)
        * 200g water (水, shuǐ)
        * 0.5g salt (盐, yán)
    * 228g pumpkin puree (南瓜蓉, nánguā róng):
        * 1 pumpkin (南瓜, nánguā)
* **Other:**
    * Salt (盐, yán)


### Instructions

1. **Prepare Vegetable Juices:** Steam and puree pumpkin. Blend spinach with water and salt to create spinach juice. Extract fire dragon fruit juice.
2. **Make Dough:** Combine flour, water, and chosen vegetable juice (fire dragon fruit, spinach, or pumpkin puree) to form a smooth dough.  Knead well and let rest for 20-30 minutes, kneading twice during this time.
3. **Roll Dough:** Roll out each colored dough into a long, thin rectangular sheet (0.5 cm thick).
4. **Cut Strips:** Cut the dough into strips, using chopsticks to create a pointed tip for easier shaping.  Remember the dimensions: 3cm wide, 25.5cm long.
5. **Create "Ji" Character:**  Cut 1cm wide white strips (from plain dough).  Use water to adhere strips to create the "Ji" character shape. The top horizontal line should be longer than the bottom.  Let rest for 15-20 minutes.
6. **Assemble Dumpling Wrappers:** Roll out 1cm thick dough.  Brush with water and layer strips to form the final shape.  The "Ji" character should be centered and aligned, ensuring equal spacing on both sides.
7. **Rest and Fill:** Let the assembled wrappers rest for 10-15 minutes before filling. The final thickness should be 2mm.
8. **Fill and Shape:** Fill the wrappers with your desired filling.  Gently squeeze the edges to seal and create the final shape.
