### Instructions

1. Prepare the ingredients: Slice the ginger, chop the scallions, mince the garlic.
2. Prepare the pork ribs: Ensure the ribs are about 1.5 inches long. Blanch in boiling water for 5 minutes to remove impurities and blood. Wash thoroughly.
3. Caramelize the sugar: Heat 25 grams of oil in a pot. Add 20 grams of rock sugar and stir until it melts and turns a reddish-brown color.
4. Sauté aromatics: Add the sliced ginger, chopped scallions, star anise, and cassia bark to the pot and stir-fry briefly.
5. Add liquids and seasonings: Add yellow wine, soy sauce, dark soy sauce, and water.  Stir well.
6. Braising the ribs: Add the pork ribs to the pot. Add salt (use sparingly).  Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat and braise for 15 minutes (for black pork ribs, 10 minutes for young pig ribs).
7. Garnish:  Gently remove the ribs and set aside.  Strain out the aromatics from the sauce.
8. Reduce the sauce: Return the ribs to the pot. Simmer the sauce for 5 minutes to thicken.
9. Thicken the sauce: Add a slurry of cornstarch (not specified in transcript) to thicken the sauce to desired consistency.
10. Finish and serve: Add a touch of sesame oil.  Gently toss the ribs in the sauce to coat evenly. Serve hot.
