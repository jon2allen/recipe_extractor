### Instructions

1. Prepare the marinade: Combine ground pork, chopped scallions, and ginger in a bowl. Add salt, MSG, soy sauce, five-spice powder, thirteen-spice powder, and pepper powder. Mix well. Add 1-2 tablespoons of water and 1.5 tablespoons of cornstarch and 30g of flour, and mix until well combined. Add optional diced bamboo shoots or water chestnuts.
2. Form the meatballs: Roll the meat mixture into 2.5 cm diameter meatballs.
3. First Fry: Heat oil in a pan until slightly smoking. Reduce heat to low. Carefully place meatballs into the hot oil, ensuring not to overcrowd the pan. Fry for about 1.5 minutes per side, until lightly browned. Remove from pan.
4. Second Fry: Once all meatballs are fried, return them to the pan and fry again for about 3 minutes, until golden brown and slightly reddish. Remove from pan.
5. Braise the Meatballs: In the same pan, stir-fry scallions and ginger until fragrant. Add cooking wine and soy sauce. Add broth, sugar, and dark soy sauce. Add the fried meatballs. Simmer for 6 minutes.
6. Thicken the sauce: Mix a small amount of cornstarch with water to create a slurry. Add the slurry to the braising liquid and stir until thickened. Drizzle with sesame oil (optional).
7. Serve: Serve the red braised meatballs hot.
