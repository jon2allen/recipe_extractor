### Instructions

1. Prepare the egg white mixture: Combine egg whites, salt, MSG, soy sauce, a little Sichuan peppercorn powder, and water starch. Whisk until stiff peaks form. Set aside.
2. Marinate the shrimp and egg yolks: Gently mix shrimp and egg yolks with a small amount of salt and MSG. Add potato starch and mix well.
3. Prepare the mushroom "ingots": Shape the mushrooms into ingot shapes. Lightly coat with flour. Fill with shrimp and egg yolk mixture. Seal tightly to prevent filling from falling out.
4. Fry the mushroom ingots: Heat vegetable oil until smoking. Fry the mushroom ingots until golden brown and cooked through, turning to ensure even browning. Remove and set aside.
5. Prepare the sauce: Heat oil in a pan. Sauté scallions and ginger until fragrant. Add the fried mushroom ingots, cooking wine, soy sauce (a small amount), broth (or water), oyster sauce (10g), sugar (5-6g), and light soy sauce. Simmer over low heat for 6-8 minutes.
6. Prepare the radish garnish:  Cut radishes into thin slices, shaping them into butterfly shapes.  Cut additional radish slices into thin strips.
7. Assemble the dish: Arrange lettuce on a serving platter. Place the mushroom ingots on top. Garnish with radish butterflies and radish strips. Thicken the sauce with a little water starch and oil. Pour sauce over the dish.
