- 1 bunch scallions, chopped for scallion water
- 1-2 taels (50-100g) water
- 1.5-2 taels (75-100g) starch (preferably soaked)
- 20g rock sugar
- 1 tael (50g) cooking wine (二合一酱油)

### Instructions

1. Prepare the scallion water: Chop scallions, add salt and MSG, mix well.
2. Prepare the meat mixture: Mix minced pork, diced pork, minced ginger, smashed water chestnuts, and scallion water.  Add 1-2 taels of water, 1.5-2 taels of starch, and mix until sticky and slightly stringy.
3. Divide the meat mixture into 5 equal portions, shaping them into meatballs.
4. Deep fry the meatballs: Heat oil in a wok or pan.  Carefully place the meatballs in the hot oil, fry for 2 minutes without disturbing, then continue frying until light brown.  Fry for another 3-5 minutes until a deep reddish-brown color is achieved.
5. Caramelize sugar: Add 20g of rock sugar to a pan and stir until melted and light golden brown.  Do not overcook.
6. Braise the meatballs: Add water to the caramelized sugar, then add the fried meatballs, cooking wine, soy sauce, and a small amount of salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes.
7. Simmer and thicken: Turn off the heat and let it simmer for 10 minutes.  Remove meatballs. Thicken the remaining sauce with a little starch. Add a touch of sesame oil or other cooking oil.
8. Serve:  Return the meatballs to the sauce. The meatballs should be tender and easily mashed.  Serve immediately.
