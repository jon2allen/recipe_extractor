### Objectives
- Learn to prepare and fry small yellow croaker fish for a crispy exterior and tender interior.
- Master the art of making a flavorful batter for even crispier results.
- Understand the importance of oil temperature control for optimal frying.


### Ingredients

- 26 small yellow croaker fish
- 1-2 stalks of scallions (approximately 1 Liang)
- 10g ginger
- 20g yellow rice wine
- 20g light soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon of flour
- 2 tablespoons of starch
- Cooking oil
- Salt
- MSG (optional)
- White pepper or black pepper (optional)
- Pepper salt for garnish (optional)


### Instructions

1. Prepare the fish: Remove the gills and entrails of the small yellow croaker fish. Rinse and set aside.
2. Make the ginger-scallion sauce: Finely chop 1-2 stalks of scallions and 10g of ginger. Add salt, MSG (optional), and mix well. Add 20g yellow rice wine and 20g light soy sauce.
3. Marinate the fish: Add the fish to the ginger-scallion sauce, ensuring they are coated evenly. Marinate for 15 minutes, mixing halfway through.
4. Prepare the batter: In a bowl, combine 1 tablespoon of flour and 2 tablespoons of starch. Add cooking oil and mix well until a smooth batter forms. The batter should coat a chopstick smoothly.
5. Coat the fish: Lightly coat the marinated fish with the batter.
6. Fry the fish: Heat cooking oil in a pan. The oil should be around 60% hot. Add the fish in batches, ensuring they don't overcrowd the pan. Fry for about 2 minutes until lightly browned.
7. Fry until golden brown: Increase the oil temperature to about 80% hot (small wisps of smoke). Continue frying until the fish is golden brown and crispy.  Break apart any fish that have stuck together during the frying process.
8. Drain and serve: Remove the fried fish and drain on paper towels. Garnish with pepper salt (optional) and serve immediately.
