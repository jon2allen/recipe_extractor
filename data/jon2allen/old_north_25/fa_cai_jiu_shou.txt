### Instructions

1. Rinse the fa cai thoroughly with water and soak.
2. Soak the fresh oysters in water for three hours.
3. Clean the pre-cooked pig's trotters using a cleaning ball.  Cut into small pieces.
4.  Boil the pig's trotters for 5 minutes, skim off the foam, rinse with cold water, and clean. (Optional: soak trotters for 2 hours or overnight before cooking).
5.  Pat the oysters dry to prevent sticking during frying.
6.  Fry the pig's trotters until browned, adding scallions and ginger to brown as well.
7.  Add yellow wine and Lee Kum Kee Zhu Hou sauce (or other similar sauce).
8.  Add light soy sauce, rock/white sugar, and a small amount of salt.
9.  Simmer for approximately 1 hour (or 50 minutes for firmer texture, 1 hour 20 minutes for very tender).
10.  50 minutes into simmering, add sesame paste to the sauce.
11.  Fry the dried oysters separately and add them to the pot along with the soaked fa cai and oyster sauce.
12.  Continue simmering until the sauce thickens naturally.
13.  Add salt and a small amount of MSG.
14.  Add a drop or two of cooking oil to the fa cai for better color and sheen.
15.  Chill the fa cai in ice water for a brighter green color.
16.  Stir-fry scallions, ginger, and garlic until fragrant.
17.  Drain the fa cai (do not squeeze).
18.  Season the fa cai with salt and a small amount of MSG.
19.  Arrange the braised pig's trotters on a plate, top with the fa cai, and drizzle with oil.
