### Instructions

1. Carve a lotus flower from a tomato for garnish.  Make 6 petals, about 1 cm deep, then carve smaller leaves within.
2. Clean the carp thoroughly, removing scales and internal organs. Pat dry with paper towels.
3. Use a large, flat knife to make cuts across the fish, about 1 inch apart and 2 finger widths wide.  This is done on both sides, but more shallowly on one side.
4. Rub the fish with salt, inside and out, then apply soy sauce for flavor and color. Marinate for 15 minutes.
5. Wipe off excess marinade with paper towels.
6. Heat oil in a pan until smoking. Add the carp and pan-fry for about 2 minutes per side.
7. In the same pan, fry the star anise and Sichuan peppercorns until fragrant. Add the ginger and scallions.
8. Return the fish to the pan, add rice wine, and cover to steam for a short time.
9. Add broth (enough to cover the fish), soy sauce, rock sugar, dark soy sauce, salt, and any optional ingredients (mushrooms, green peas).
10. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to a simmer for 20 minutes.
11. After 5 minutes of simmering, add white sugar.
12. After 20 minutes, remove the star anise and Sichuan peppercorns.
13. Remove the fish from the pan and add a little more dark soy sauce to deepen the color.
14. Thicken the sauce with a cornstarch slurry.
15. Return the fish to the sauce, add sesame oil, and toss to coat.
16. Serve hot.
