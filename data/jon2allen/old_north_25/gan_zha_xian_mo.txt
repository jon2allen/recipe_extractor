### Objectives
- Learn to prepare and fry mushrooms for a crispy, tender texture.
- Master a simple batter recipe for even coating and optimal crispness.
- Understand the importance of oil temperature control for perfect frying.


### Ingredients

- Mushrooms (amount not specified, but enough to fill three batches)
- Salt (a generous amount)
- 1-2 grams green onions (葱)
- 5-8 grams ginger (姜)
- 1.5 tablespoons all-purpose flour (面粉)
- 2 liang (approximately 50g) potato starch (土豆淀粉)
- 0.5 liang (approximately 12.5g) oil (油)
- 1 egg (蛋液)
- Thirteen spice (十三香) or five-spice powder (五香粉) or pepper powder (花椒面) (amount not specified)
- MSG (味精) (amount not specified)


### Instructions

1. Remove the stems from the mushrooms and tear them into large pieces (about three fingers wide).
2. Sprinkle a generous amount of salt on the mushrooms.
3. Prepare the ginger and green onion juice:  Mix 1-2 grams of green onions, 5-8 grams of ginger, and a pinch of salt.
4. Prepare the batter: In a bowl, whisk together half of an egg, 1.5 tablespoons of all-purpose flour, 2 liang of potato starch, and 0.5 liang of oil. Mix until the batter is slightly thin but still coats the back of a spoon.
5. Wash the salted mushrooms thoroughly, squeezing out excess water.  Wrap in cheesecloth to remove additional moisture.
6. Prepare the seasoning: Mix thirteen spice or five-spice powder or pepper powder, and MSG.
7. Dip each mushroom piece in the batter, ensuring it's fully coated.
8. Fry the mushrooms in batches in hot oil, ensuring the oil is hot enough but not smoking.  Fry until golden brown and crispy.  Avoid overcrowding the pan.
9. Once fried, remove the mushrooms and drain on a wire rack or paper towels.
10. Serve immediately.  The mushrooms should be tender inside and crispy outside.
