3. Combine fish and chicken:  Mix the fish and chicken, adding spring onion and ginger water, salt, and MSG. Mix well.
4. Prepare the batter:  Squeeze out excess water from the fish and chicken mixture. Add chicken broth, more spring onion and ginger water, egg whites, water starch, and MSG. Mix well.  (Add salt to taste if needed). Beat for 1 minute using a mixer (add ice if using a high-speed mixer to prevent overcooking).
