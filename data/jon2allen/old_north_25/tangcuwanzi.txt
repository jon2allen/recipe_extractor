6. Carefully add the meatballs to the hot oil, ensuring not to overcrowd the pan.
7. Fry the meatballs until they are golden brown and slightly crispy (approximately 3 minutes).
8. Remove the fried meatballs from the pan and set aside.
9. In the same pan, add minced garlic and saute briefly.
10. Add tomato paste, white sugar, and rice vinegar to the pan. Stir well to combine.
11. Add 3 tablespoons of water and salt to taste. Bring to a simmer.
12. Mix 2 tablespoons of potato starch with a small amount of cold water to create a slurry.
13. Gradually add the starch slurry to the sauce, stirring constantly until the sauce thickens and becomes glossy.
14. Add the fried meatballs to the sauce and gently toss to coat.
15.  Optional: Add a dash of sesame oil for extra flavor.
