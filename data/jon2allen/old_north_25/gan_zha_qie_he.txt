### Objectives
- Learn to make delicious and crispy dry fried eggplant boxes.
- Master the technique of preparing the eggplant slices and meat filling.
- Achieve a golden-brown color and crispy texture through a double-frying method.


### Ingredients

- 20 eggplants (about 40 slices, 3mm thick)
- 4 Liang (approximately 200g) pork
- 20g scallions
- 4g ginger
- Soy sauce (amount not specified)
- Salt (amount not specified)
- Pepper (amount not specified)
- A little cornstarch (少给一点)
- A little water (少给它加上点水)
- MSG (味精) (amount not specified)
- 1/2 egg
- 1 tablespoon white flour
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch
- Soybean oil (豆油) for frying
- Pepper salt (椒盐) for seasoning


### Instructions

1. Peel the eggplants and slice them into 3mm thick pieces.  The video suggests a specific cutting technique (“夹刀片”), but recommends simply slicing them thinly if this is difficult.
2. Prepare the meat filling: Mix the pork, scallions, ginger, soy sauce, salt, pepper, a small amount of cornstarch, a little water, and MSG in a bowl.  Mix well.
3. Make small meatballs from the meat mixture and flatten them slightly.
4. Prepare the batter: Whisk together 1/2 egg, 1 tablespoon white flour, and 2 tablespoons cornstarch. Add a small amount of oil to the batter for crispier results.
5. Dip each eggplant slice in the batter, allowing excess batter to drip off.
6. Fry the eggplant boxes in hot soybean oil in batches.  The video recommends frying in two batches, then combining them for the second frying.
7. The first frying should be until the eggplant boxes are cooked through and the batter is set. You'll hear a sizzling sound indicating the steam is escaping.
8. After the first frying, let the eggplant boxes drain.
9. Fry the eggplant boxes a second time to achieve a golden-brown color and crispy texture.
10. Remove the eggplant boxes from the oil and drain well.
11. Serve immediately with pepper salt.
