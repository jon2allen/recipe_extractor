### Instructions

1. Slice pork into 4-5mm thick pieces.  Pound gently to tenderize the meat fibers.
2. Marinate pork with salt, soy sauce, and 25g water for 5 minutes.
3. Mix potato starch with 20g water until a thick paste forms.
4. Prepare the sauce: In a bowl, combine 25g water, a pinch of salt, a pinch of MSG, soy sauce, 5g aged rice vinegar, 45g 9-degree rice vinegar, sugar, and a little sesame oil.  Mix well.  Add minced garlic.
5. Heat oil in a wok or large pan until hot enough to sizzle a drop of water.
6. Coat the marinated pork in the potato starch mixture.
7. Fry the pork in batches until golden brown and slightly firm.  Remove and drain.
8. Increase the oil temperature to medium-high heat.
9. Return the fried pork to the hot oil for a second fry (吐油法), until golden brown and crispy. This step removes excess moisture and makes the meat crispier.
10. While the pork is frying, prepare the garnish: thinly slice green onions, ginger, carrots, and cilantro.
11. Once the pork is perfectly fried, add the prepared garnish to the wok.
12. Pour the sauce over the pork and toss gently to coat.
13. Serve immediately.
