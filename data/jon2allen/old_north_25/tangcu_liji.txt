### Instructions

1. Cut the pork tenderloin into 1.5cm thick strips.
2. Marinate the pork strips with salt, soy sauce, and a little cooking wine for 10 minutes.
3. Prepare the batter: Mix potato starch, 25g oil, and water until a thick, sticky consistency is achieved.
4. Heat oil in a pan until it slightly smokes.  Test the oil temperature by dropping a drop of water; it should sizzle immediately.
5. Coat the pork strips in the batter and fry in batches until golden brown and crispy (approximately 2 minutes per batch). Remove and set aside.
6. Prepare the sauce: Mix white vinegar, rice vinegar, aged black vinegar, tomato ketchup, white sugar, and salt (and optionally MSG) in a bowl.  Add a small amount of water to adjust consistency.
7. Add a little oil to a pan. Saute green onions, ginger, and garlic.
8. Add the sauce to the pan and bring to a simmer until thickened.
9. Add the fried pork to the sauce, coating evenly.
10. Add a little starch slurry (starch and water mixture) for thickening, if needed.
11. Serve immediately.  The dish is best enjoyed after resting for 40 minutes, as the batter will remain crispy.


**Important Notes:**

- Do not add flour or eggs to the batter.
- Use potato starch for the batter, not other types of starch.
- Adjust the amount of sugar and vinegar in the sauce to your preference.
