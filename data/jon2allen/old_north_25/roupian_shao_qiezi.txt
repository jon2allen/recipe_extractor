### Ingredients

- 1.5 jin (approximately 750g) long eggplant (长茄子)

- Scallions (葱)
- Ginger (姜)

### Instructions

1. Cut the eggplant into large, roughly 8cm long and 4-5cm wide,  dice-shaped pieces (滚刀块).  Avoid cutting them too small.
2. Heat the oil in a wok to 70% heat.  Test the oil temperature by adding a drop of water; it should sizzle immediately.
3. Fry the eggplant pieces until lightly golden brown.  This process helps to remove excess moisture and create a better texture. The eggplant should appear slightly golden.
4. Remove the eggplant from the wok and set aside.
5. Add pork slices to the wok and stir-fry until fragrant over high heat.
6. Add scallions, ginger, and garlic to the wok and stir-fry until fragrant.
7. Add yellow wine and soy sauce, and stir-fry until fragrant.
8. Add dark soy sauce, white sugar, and an appropriate amount of salt to taste.
9. Return the fried eggplant to the wok.  Simmer for 2-3 minutes to allow the flavors to penetrate.
10. Add the green peppers and stir-fry.
11. Add MSG.
12. Thicken the sauce with a cornstarch slurry (雨淋芡).
13. Add minced garlic and old Chen vinegar.
14. Serve immediately. The sauce should coat the eggplant, but not be overly watery.
