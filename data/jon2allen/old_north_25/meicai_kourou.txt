### Instructions

1. Soak the Mei Cai in 1.5斤 (approx. 750g) of boiling water.  The amount of Mei Cai can be adjusted to your liking.
2. Cut the pork belly into small squares.
3. Heat a pan until smoking hot. Briefly sear the pork belly to remove excess water and hair.  (Caution: Be careful not to burn yourself).
4. Blanch the pork belly in boiling water for 2 minutes.
5. Wash the pork belly again.
6. Place the pork belly in a pot of cold water with scallions, ginger, star anise, and beer.  A small amount of liquid is sufficient.  The remaining broth can be used for other dishes.
7. Simmer the pork belly for 15-20 minutes.
8. Rinse the Mei Cai thoroughly 4 times, using the same water each time.  (Changing the water frequently will reduce the flavor.)
9. Prepare the marinade: Mix fermented tofu paste, half a block of fermented tofu, beer, white sugar, soy sauce (light and dark), and oyster sauce. Adjust the amount of soy sauce to your preference.
10. Use a toothpick or meat tenderizer to pierce the pork belly several times to help it absorb the marinade.
11. Apply the marinade evenly to the pork belly. Let it sit for at least 15 minutes (or up to 30 minutes).
12. Heat oil in a pan and stir-fry garlic, ginger, and scallions until fragrant.
13. Add the Mei Cai and stir-fry until fragrant.
14. Add the pork belly to the pan and mix with some of the pork broth.
15. Transfer the Mei Cai and pork belly to a heatproof dish, pressing down firmly.
16. Cover with a plate and steam for 1 hour and 10 minutes, or until the pork is tender.
17. Optional: Add a little cooking oil before serving to make the dish look more appealing.
18. Serve.  (For a glossier finish, thicken the sauce with a cornstarch slurry before serving).
