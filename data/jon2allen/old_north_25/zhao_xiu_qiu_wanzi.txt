### Ingredients

- 香菜梗 (coriander stalks): 5cm segments
- 葱 (scallions): thinly sliced
- 胡萝卜 (carrots): julienned
- 香菇丝 (optional shiitake mushroom shreds)
- 盐 (salt): to taste
- 鸡蛋 (egg): 1
- 葱末 (chopped scallions)
- 花椒面 (pepper powder): a pinch
- 味精 (MSG): a pinch
- 酱油 (soy sauce): a small amount
- 香油 (sesame oil): a small amount
- 淀粉 (starch): 1 Liang (approx 50g)
- 面粉 (flour): 1 Liang (approx 50g)
- 油 (oil): for frying


### Instructions

1. Prepare the vegetables: Cut coriander stalks into 5cm segments, thinly slice scallions, julienne carrots, and optionally add shiitake mushroom shreds.
2. Marinate the vegetables: Combine all the prepared vegetables in a bowl. Add salt, mix well, and let it marinate for 5 minutes. Squeeze out excess water and rinse twice.
3. Make the mixture: Add egg, chopped scallions, pepper powder, salt, MSG, a small amount of soy sauce, and sesame oil to the marinated vegetables. Mix well.
4. Combine dry ingredients: Mix equal amounts of starch and flour (1 Liang each).
5. Form the balls: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the vegetable mixture, mixing until it forms a cohesive dough. Roll into small balls.
6. Check oil temperature: Heat oil in a wok or pan. Test the oil temperature by dropping a small amount of water into it; it should sizzle immediately. Reduce heat to medium-low.
7. Fry the balls: Gently place the vegetable balls into the hot oil, ensuring not to overcrowd the pan. Fry for approximately 2 minutes per side, until golden brown and crispy.
8. Serve: Remove the fried balls from the oil and serve immediately.  The exterior should be crispy, and the inside tender.
