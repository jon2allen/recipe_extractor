### Instructions

1. Prepare the filling: Mix pork, garlic, ginger, salt, MSG, soy sauce, five-spice powder, Sichuan pepper powder (or thirteen-spice), sesame oil, and a small amount of starch. Add 1-1.5 Liang of water to lock in moisture.
2. Prepare the lotus root: Clean and slice lotus root into appropriate sizes.  Ensure the slices are large enough to hold the filling.
3. Assemble the lotus root boxes: Place a spoonful of filling onto each lotus root slice. Top with another slice to create a box.
4. Prepare the batter: In a separate bowl, whisk together one whole egg, flour, 1.5 scoops of potato starch, 25g soybean oil, and enough water to achieve a smooth, slightly thick batter.
5. Coat the lotus root boxes: Dip each assembled lotus root box into the batter, ensuring it's fully coated.
6. Fry the lotus root boxes: Heat approximately 30g of oil in a wok or frying pan. Carefully place the battered lotus root boxes into the hot oil.
7. Fry until golden brown and crispy: Fry until the lotus root boxes are golden brown and crispy, and a sizzling sound indicates they are cooked through.
8. Drain excess oil: Remove the fried lotus root boxes from the oil and place them on a wire rack or paper towel to drain excess oil.
9. Season and serve: Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot.
