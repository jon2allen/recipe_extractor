### Instructions

1. Clean the shrimp: Cut off the antennae and legs.  Make an incision along the back of the shrimp, about 1/3 of the way down, to remove the vein.  Make a shallow slice along the back of the shrimp, about 4/5 of the way through the meat.
2. Prepare the green onions: Slice the green onions into 7-10mm thick pieces.  Use a toothpick to create a pattern in the green onion slices by inserting the toothpick and twisting.  Break off the toothpick.
3. Heat the lard in a pan and sauté the green onions and ginger until fragrant.
4. Add the shrimp to the pan and pan-fry until slightly browned on both sides.
5. Add cooking wine, light soy sauce (20g), a small amount of salt, meat broth, and white sugar (40g).
6. Add a small amount of tomato paste to enhance the color.
7. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for approximately 6 minutes, shaking the pan every 2 minutes.
8. Once the sauce has thickened, remove the green onions and ginger.
9. Add a small amount of MSG and sesame oil.
10. Arrange the shrimp on a plate and serve.  The sauce should coat the shrimp beautifully.
