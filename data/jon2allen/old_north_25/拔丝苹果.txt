拔丝苹果.txt -  Sugar-Coated Apples

### Objectives
- Learn to make crispy, sweet sugar-coated apples.
- Master the technique of creating a perfect sugar syrup.
- Understand the importance of oil temperature and frying time.


### Ingredients

- Sesame seeds (black and white)
- Crystallized red plums (切一下,  sliced)
- Green plums (青梅)
- Red Fuji apples (红富士苹果)
- 1 whole egg (全蛋一个)
- 25g oil (25克油)
- 1-2 tablespoons flour (面粉上一两)
- 3-4 tablespoons potato starch (土豆淀粉三两)
- 4 liang (两) white sugar (白糖)


### Instructions

1. Prepare the apples: Wash and cut the Red Fuji apples into fourths, removing the core.  Cut each quarter into segments resembling orange segments (橘子瓣花刀).
2. Prepare the batter: In a bowl, whisk together a whole egg, 25g of oil, 1-2 tablespoons of flour, and 3-4 tablespoons of potato starch until a smooth batter forms.  The batter should be thick enough that you can’t see your fingers when you put them in.
3. Coat the apples: Dip each apple segment into the batter, ensuring it's fully coated.  Let any excess batter drip off.
4. Fry the apples: Heat oil in a pan to about 60% temperature (slightly smoking). Fry the apple segments in batches, ensuring not to overcrowd the pan. Fry for about 30 seconds, until golden and crispy. Remove and drain on a wire rack.
5. Make the sugar syrup: In a clean pan, add 4 liang of white sugar. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar melts and turns a light amber color (香油色).  The bubbles will transition from large to small.  Turn off the heat once the desired color is achieved.
6. Coat with syrup: Quickly dip the fried apple segments into the hot sugar syrup, ensuring they are evenly coated.  Remove and place on a plate.
7. Garnish: Sprinkle with black and white sesame seeds.
8. Serve immediately: Serve the sugar-coated apples while they are still hot and crispy.  They can be dipped in water or other beverages for added flavor.
