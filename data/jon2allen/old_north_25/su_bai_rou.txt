### Objectives
- Learn to make crispy white meat ("Su Bai Rou").
- Master the technique of creating a light and crispy batter.
- Achieve the perfect balance of crispy exterior and tender interior.
- Learn to make a delicious and non-sticky glaze.


### Ingredients

- 350g pork (pork belly, cut into thin, wide strips resembling spareribs)
- 2 egg whites
- 30-35g oil
- 2 scoops of starch (likely cornstarch or potato starch)
- 30-40g all-purpose flour
- Water (amount to adjust batter consistency)
- Oil for deep frying
- 200g sugar
- Water for sugar syrup
- Small amount of oil for sugar syrup
- Sesame seeds
- Orange or other citrus juice (optional)


### Instructions

1. Prepare the batter: In a bowl, whisk together 2 egg whites, 30-35g oil, 2 scoops of starch, and 30-40g of flour. Gradually add water, mixing until the batter is thick but pourable, like a thick pancake batter.  The batter should coat the pork well and allow it to float in the oil.

2. Prepare the pork:  Do not coat the pork with flour.

3. Deep fry the pork: Heat oil in a wok or deep fryer. Dip each pork strip into the batter, ensuring it's fully coated. Carefully place the battered pork into the hot oil; it should float to the surface and puff up. Fry until golden and crispy (about 2 minutes), then remove.

4. Adjust the oil temperature: Once the first batch is fried, increase the oil temperature to 70% heat.  Fry the remaining pork strips, ensuring they puff up.

5. Drain the oil: After frying, remove the pork and place it on a wire rack to drain excess oil, ensuring a crispy exterior and tender interior.  The sound of the pork should be hollow when tapped.

6. Make the glaze: In a separate pan, melt 200g of sugar over low heat. Add a small amount of water and a little oil.  Cook until the sugar turns a light amber color ("ivory yellow"), resembling a light caramel.

7. Combine and coat: Turn off the heat. Add the fried pork to the glaze and stir gently to coat evenly, creating a glossy finish.

8. Garnish and serve: Sprinkle sesame seeds over the glazed pork.  Drizzle with orange juice (or other citrus juice) for added flavor. Serve immediately. The finished dish should be crispy and easily break apart like snowflakes.
