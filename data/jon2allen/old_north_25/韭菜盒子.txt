### Instructions

1. Prepare the dough: Mix 1 jin of flour with 3g of salt. Gradually add hot water, testing the consistency until a workable dough forms. Add cold water as needed. Knead until smooth, let rest for 15-20 minutes, then knead again.

2. Prepare the egg filling: Whisk 3 eggs with a pinch of salt. Cook the eggs in a pan over low heat until set. Set aside.

3. Prepare the leek filling: Mix the cooked eggs with the leeks, oil, salt, and a pinch of MSG (optional).  Ensure the leeks are well combined with the other ingredients.

4. Prepare the sour cabbage filling (optional): Mix sour cabbage with soy sauce, scallions, ginger, garlic, and a small amount of oil, Sichuan peppercorns, and star anise. Add a pinch of MSG and Sichuan pepper powder.

5. Assemble the leek boxes: Using the first method, take a piece of dough, flatten it, and place the filling in the center. Fold the dough over the filling, creating a half-circle shape. Pinch the edges to seal.

6. Assemble the leek boxes (alternative method): Use the second method. Flatten a piece of dough, add filling, and seal, pressing firmly to release air.

7. Cook the leek boxes: Heat oil in a pan. Add the leek boxes and cook until golden brown on both sides, adding a little water to help soften them.
