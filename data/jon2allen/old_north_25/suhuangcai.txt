- Learn how to make a flavorful dipping sauce.

### Ingredients

- 3 small eggs
- Salt (a pinch)
- 1.5 tablespoons water starch (淀粉, diànfěn)
- Oil (for frying, amount not specified)
- 3 liang (两, liǎng) sugar (糖, táng)
- 1 liang water (水, shuǐ)
- Sesame seeds (熟芝麻, shú zhīma)


### Instructions

1. Crack 3 small eggs (or 2 large eggs) into a bowl. Add a pinch of salt and mix well.
2. Soak water starch and drain excess water. Add 1.5 tablespoons of the drained water starch to the egg mixture and stir.
3. Heat oil in a pan until it smokes. Remove the oil and wipe the pan clean with paper towels.
4. Reduce heat to low. Pour egg mixture into the pan, swirling to coat the bottom.
5. Cook until the egg is mostly set but still slightly wet. Gently lift and fold the egg.
6. Cut the cooked egg into diamond shapes (approximately 3 cm wide).
7. Prepare the dipping sauce: Heat a small amount of oil in a pan. Add 3 liang sugar and 1 liang water. Stir until the mixture bubbles, then reduce heat and cook until a light brown color is achieved.
8. Heat oil in a separate pan to medium heat (about 50% oil temperature).  Dip chopsticks in water before adding egg rolls to prevent sticking.
9. Fry the egg rolls until golden brown and crispy (approximately 3 minutes).
10. Remove egg rolls and drain excess oil.
11. Drizzle the dipping sauce over the egg rolls. Sprinkle with sesame seeds.
12. Serve immediately with your choice of dipping sauce (e.g., orange juice, grapefruit juice, apple juice, pear juice).
