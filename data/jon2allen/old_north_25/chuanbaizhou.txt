### Instructions

1. Scrape the skin of the pork belly with a sharp knife.
2. Cut the ginger into 3-5 slices.
3. Chop the scallions.
4. Rinse the pickled mustard greens thoroughly under running water to remove excess salt.  Squeeze out excess water.
5. Place the pork belly, ginger, scallions, and star anise in a pot.

9. After one hour, remove the spices from the pot.
10. Add more boiling water to the pot, skimming off any foam.
11. Add the rinsed pickled mustard greens to the pot.
12. Bring the pot to a boil again and simmer for 4 minutes.
13. Season with salt to taste.
14. Continue to simmer for another 6 minutes (for a total of 10 minutes after adding the pickled mustard greens).
15.  While the pork is simmering, thinly slice the pork belly (approximately 2-3mm thick).
16. If using starch noodles, add them to the pot and cook until they float to the surface (approximately 2 minutes).
17. Add pepper and MSG (optional) to the pot.
18. Add the thinly sliced pork belly to the pot and cook until heated through.
19. Remove the pork belly from the pot and arrange it on a plate.
