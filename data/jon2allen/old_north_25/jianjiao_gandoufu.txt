### Instructions

1. Prepare the dried tofu: Cut into 1.5cm thick slices (象眼片 - xiàngyǎn piàn). Boil in water for 3 minutes. Add about 1 gram of alkali or baking soda and boil for another 30 seconds until slippery.
2. Prepare the pork: If using pork belly, cut into small strips. If using lean pork and no lard is available, proceed directly to step 3.
3. Heat soybean oil in a wok or pan. Add the pork and stir-fry until fragrant.
4. Add scallions, ginger, and a small amount of garlic and Sichuan peppercorns (or Sichuan peppercorn water).
5. Add soy sauce and yellow wine. Stir-fry briefly.
6. Add water (or meat broth).  If using lean pork and no lard, add a small amount of lard at this stage for flavor.
7. Add salt, MSG, and optional chicken bouillon.
8. Simmer until flavors meld.
9. Thicken the sauce: Drizzle in the sauce slowly, like rain (雨淋片 - yǔ lín piàn), ensuring it's evenly distributed.
10. Add the prepared dried tofu and chili peppers to the sauce.
11. Stir gently until the tofu is coated in the sauce and heated through.  The finished dish should be glossy and slippery (得了得嗖的 - dé le de sōu de).
12. Serve hot.
