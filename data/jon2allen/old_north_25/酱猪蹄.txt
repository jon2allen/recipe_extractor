- A small amount of sugar for caramelization
- 40g fermented soybean paste (东北大豆酱 - dōng běi dà dòu jiàng)
- 1 liang (approximately 50g) soy sauce (生抽 - shēng chōu)
- Salt (to taste, approximately 3 times the amount used for regular stir-fry)

### Instructions

1. Prepare the spice mixture: Combine star anise, peppercorns, smashed 草果 (cao guo), cinnamon bark, 白芷 (bái zhǐ), small fennel, bay leaves, and gardenia. Rinse to remove dust.
2. Soak the pork trotters: Soak the pork trotters in water for 10 hours (or at least 2 hours) to remove hairs and impurities.  Pat dry.
3. Sear the pork trotters: Heat oil in a pot over high heat.  Sear the pork trotters until golden brown on all sides. This helps the skin become crispy and enhances the color.
4.  Prepare the braising liquid: In a separate pan, heat 15g of oil. Add a small amount of sugar to create a light caramel color. Do not overcook.
5. Add aromatics: Add garlic, ginger, chili segments to the caramelized sugar and stir-fry until fragrant.
6. Add the fermented soybean paste and soy sauce: Add 40g of fermented soybean paste and 1 liang of soy sauce. Stir well.
7. Add spices and salt: Add the prepared spice mixture and a generous amount of salt (approximately 3 times the amount used for regular stir-fry).  The taste should be salty.
8. Add the seared pork trotters: Add the seared pork trotters to the pot.
9. Add water and alcohol: Add 4 jin of water and 20g of white liquor or yellow wine.
10. Braise the pork trotters: Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes.  Then continue to simmer covered for an additional 30 minutes.  (The video notes that the cooking time may need to be longer depending on the toughness of the trotters - up to 2.5 hours for very tough trotters).
11. Check for tenderness: The pork trotters are done when a chopstick easily pierces the meat.
12. Serve: Serve the braised pork trotters hot.  They can be stored for several days without discoloration.
