4. Quickly stir-fry the pork strips until they are cooked through and tender. Remove from the wok.
5. Prepare the 京酱 (Jingjiang) sauce: In a wok or pan, combine sweet bean sauce, fermented soybean paste, and stir well.
6. Add sugar and stir-fry until slightly caramelized but not browned.
7. Reduce heat, add yellow rice wine, light soy sauce, and stir well.
8. Add MSG and a small amount of water starch slurry to thicken the sauce slightly.
9. Stir in sesame oil.
10. Steam dried tofu slices for 5 minutes.
