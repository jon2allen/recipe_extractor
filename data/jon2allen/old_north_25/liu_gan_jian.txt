### Instructions
1. Slice the pig liver into thin, even pieces about the thickness of two coins.  The slices should be long and thin (柳叶片 - liǔ yè piàn).
2. Prepare the sauce: In a bowl, combine meat broth (1.5 tablespoons), salt, MSG, a small amount of white sugar, 25g soy sauce, light soy sauce, 10g aged vinegar, and water starch. Add most of the minced garlic.
3. Marinate the liver: Toss the liver with dry starch to prevent moisture loss during cooking.
4. Heat the oil: Heat cooking oil to about 40% heat (medium-low heat).  Too high a temperature will result in tough liver.
5. Stir-fry aromatics: Add scallions, ginger, and a small amount of minced garlic to the pan and stir-fry briefly.
6. Add peppers: Add the red and green peppers and stir-fry until slightly softened.
7. Add liver and sauce: Add the marinated liver to the pan and quickly stir-fry. Pour the prepared sauce over the liver.
8. Simmer:  Simmer until the sauce thickens and the liver is almost fully cooked but still slightly pink inside (90% cooked).  The goal is for the liver to be tender and juicy, with a slightly glossy appearance.
9. Serve: Serve immediately.
