### Instructions

1.  Sear the pork belly skin in a hot pan until lightly browned to remove excess odor.
2.  Boil the pork belly in a pot of water with ginger and scallions for 50 minutes (40 minutes if thinly sliced).  Do not add other seasonings.
3.  Prepare the garlic paste: Crush garlic cloves, coriander stems, and salt into a smooth paste. Add a little mineral water and MSG to achieve a smooth, paste-like consistency.
4.  Prepare the garlic sauce: Combine aged rice vinegar, sesame oil, and chili oil in a bowl.
5.  Once the pork belly is cooked, easily pierced with chopsticks, and the broth runs clear, remove it from the pot.
6.  Slice the pork belly thinly.  The thinner the better.
7.  Arrange the sliced pork belly on a plate, overlapping slightly.
8.  Steam the arranged pork belly for 5 minutes (3 minutes if arranged in a wave pattern).
9.  Serve the pork belly with either garlic paste or garlic sauce.  Enjoy hot in winter and cold in summer.
