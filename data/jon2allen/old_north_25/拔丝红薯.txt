### Objectives
- Learn to make crispy, sweet, and stringy Balsamic Sweet Potato.
- Master the technique of frying sweet potatoes to achieve a golden-brown color.

### Ingredients

- Sweet potatoes (干面地瓜 - dry-textured sweet potato)
- Potato starch (土豆粉)
- Vegetable oil (油)
- Sugar (糖)
- Sesame seeds (芝麻)
- Optional Dipping Sauces: Mayonnaise (色拉酱), Ketchup (番茄沙司), Condensed Milk (炼乳)


### Instructions
1. Prepare the sweet potatoes: Cut sweet potatoes into 4cm x 6cm pieces using a rolling knife cut (滚刀块).
2. Blanch the sweet potatoes: Boil the sweet potatoes for approximately 1 minute until slightly translucent. Immediately rinse with cold water to stop the cooking process and prevent sticking.
3. Coat with potato starch: Drain the sweet potatoes and thoroughly coat them with potato starch.
4. First Fry: Deep fry the sweet potatoes in hot oil over medium-high heat for 1.5-2 minutes, until slightly softened. Remove and set aside.
5. Second Fry: Increase the heat to high and fry the sweet potatoes again for another 5 minutes, until golden brown and crispy.  Adjust the heat as needed to maintain a good frying temperature.
6. Make the sugar syrup: In a separate pan, heat a small amount of water and sugar over medium heat. Stir until the sugar dissolves and the mixture turns a light golden-brown color (香油色).
7. Coat with sugar syrup: Add the fried sweet potatoes to the sugar syrup and toss to coat evenly.  The syrup should create a thin, glossy coating (挂霜).
8. Garnish and serve: Sprinkle with sesame seeds. Serve immediately while still hot and crispy.  Enjoy with your choice of dipping sauce.
