### Instructions

1. Prepare the ginger-scallion sauce: Slice ginger, chop scallions, and combine them in a bowl with yellow wine and salt. Mix well.
2. Prepare the shrimp: Pat shrimp dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture.  This is crucial for proper marinating.
3. Marinate the shrimp: Add the ginger-scallion mixture to the shrimp. Add half an egg white and starch. Mix gently to coat the shrimp evenly.  Let it marinate for 5 minutes.
4. Prepare the garnish: Arrange a goldfish cracker on the serving plate.  Add cherry tomatoes or chili pepper slices as desired.
5. Prepare the sauce: In a separate bowl, combine chicken or meat broth, salt, MSG, rice vinegar, sugar, and a generous amount of starch. Mix well.
6. Stir-fry aromatics: Heat oil in a wok or pan. Add sliced ginger and garlic and stir-fry until fragrant. Add a splash of yellow wine.
7. Add the shrimp: Add the marinated shrimp to the wok and stir-fry until they turn pink and are cooked through.  The cooking time is short.
8. Add the sauce: Pour the prepared sauce into the wok and stir quickly to create a glossy coating on the shrimp. The sauce should be slightly thicker than rice soup.
9. Serve:  Transfer the shrimp to the prepared plate with the garnish. The dish should be vibrant in color, tender, and flavorful.
