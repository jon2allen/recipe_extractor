### Instructions

1. Boil 4 Liang of water.
2. Prepare the vegetables:  Cut Chinese cabbage into pointed shapes, and carrots into triangular “ivory strips.” Insert the carrot strips into the cabbage.  Use red pepper for visual appeal.
3. Boil the dried shrimp for 5 minutes, then reduce the heat and remove the shrimp.
4. Prepare the dough for the imitation sea cucumber: Mix 1 Liang of all-purpose flour, 2 Liang of potato starch, and 1.5 Liang of all-purpose flour with water. Knead for 2 minutes, let it rest for 5-6 minutes, and knead again.
5. Prepare the black mixture: Add vegetable charcoal powder to boiling water. Stir until the color is clear.
6. For the home-style version, form small (approximately 30g) dough balls.
7. Roll the dough balls into the shape of sea cucumbers using chopsticks.  Roll them into a thicker end and thinner end.
8. Boil the shaped dough for 2 minutes.
9. For the commercial version, add shrimp paste, fish paste, or other seafood paste to the dough.
10.  Combine the home-style and commercial versions (if making both).  Re-boil until they float.  Adding cuttlefish ink will enhance the color.
11. For plating, arrange the imitation sea cucumbers in ice water for a better look.
12. Prepare the accompanying meat dish: Stir-fry meat slices until browned.  Then add dried shrimp and stir-fry until fragrant (approximately 1 minute).
13. Add ginger, garlic, and scallions.  Stir-fry, then add yellow wine, soy sauce, and a small amount of dark soy sauce for color.
14. Add other ingredients, and seasonings (salt, a pinch of sugar).
15. Thicken the sauce with a slurry. Drizzle the sauce over the dish.
16. Add sesame oil or other cooking oil.
