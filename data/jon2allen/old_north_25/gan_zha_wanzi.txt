### Objectives
- Learn to make delicious and crispy dry fried meatballs.
- Master the technique of creating a flavorful meatball mixture.
- Understand the importance of oil temperature and frying time for optimal results.


### Ingredients

- 500g (three parts lean meat, seven parts fatty meat) pork
- 10g ginger, minced
- 20g scallions, minced
- 30g water
- 25g soy sauce
- 5g salt
- A pinch of MSG
- 1.5 tablespoons cornstarch
- 2 tablespoons water
- Five-spice powder
- Thirteen-spice powder
- Pepper powder


### Instructions

1. Mince the scallions and mix them with salt until sticky.  This helps release the flavor.
2. Mix the minced ginger, pork, water, soy sauce, salt, MSG, cornstarch, water, five-spice powder, thirteen-spice powder, and pepper powder in a bowl. Mix until the mixture becomes sticky.
3. Roll the meat mixture into 3cm diameter meatballs.
4. Heat oil in a wok or deep fryer to medium-high heat.
5. Gently place the meatballs into the hot oil, ensuring they are not crowded.  Fry in batches if necessary.
6. Fry for approximately 2 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking and ensure even cooking.  The meatballs should be golden brown.
7. Remove the meatballs and set aside.
8. Increase the oil temperature to medium-high heat (around 60% heat).
9. Re-fry the meatballs for a short time to crisp the exterior and remove excess oil. This step helps achieve a crispy exterior and tender interior.  The meatballs should make a sizzling sound.
10. Remove the meatballs from the oil and drain on a wire rack.
11. Serve immediately with a sprinkle of chili salt (optional).
