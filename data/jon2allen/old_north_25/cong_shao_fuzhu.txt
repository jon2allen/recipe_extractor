### Instructions

1. Soak dried bean curd sheets in water for 40 minutes until slightly firm in the center.  Rinse twice and squeeze out excess water thoroughly.
2. Prepare the scallions: Cut into large pieces to maximize surface area for better flavor release.
3. Prepare the aromatics:  Mince ginger. Prepare Sichuan peppercorns and star anise.
4. Heat oil in a wok or pan to 70% heat. Add scallions and stir-fry until light golden yellow. Remove and set aside, reserving the oil.
5. Add a small amount of fresh oil to the wok/pan.  Add ginger, Sichuan peppercorns, and star anise. Stir-fry until fragrant, but do not brown.
6. Add Shaoxing rice wine, soy sauce, and oyster sauce. Stir well.
7. Add the soaked bean curd sheets to the wok/pan and allow them to absorb the sauce for approximately 2 minutes.
8. Add salt, sugar, and optional MSG. Stir to combine.
9. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens and coats the bean curd sheets evenly.  This process should take approximately 6 minutes.
10. Thicken the sauce with a cornstarch slurry (not specified in the transcript) if needed.
11. Add the previously stir-fried scallions back into the pan. Stir to combine.
12.  Garnish with additional oil for shine.
