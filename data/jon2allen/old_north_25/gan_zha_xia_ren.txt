### Ingredients

- Shrimp (amount not specified)
- Green broccoli (amount not specified)
- 1.5 cm thick daikon radish (amount not specified)
- Scallions and ginger (amount not specified, for marinade)
- Salt (amount not specified)
- Cooking wine (small amount, for marinade)
- MSG (amount not specified)
- Pepper (amount not specified)
- ½ egg (for batter)
- Soybean oil (amount not specified, for batter and frying)
- Starch/cornstarch (amount not specified, for batter)
- Water (amount not specified, for batter)


### Instructions

1. Prepare the marinade: Marinate shrimp with scallions, ginger, salt, and a little cooking wine.  Rub vigorously to ensure even flavor penetration. Let it sit for a while.
2. Prepare the vegetables: Cut broccoli into halves, then into smaller pieces. Cut daikon radish into 1.5 cm thick sticks, then remove the corners to create a four-sided flower shape.  Blanch broccoli until green.
3. Prepare the shrimp: Pat shrimp dry to remove excess moisture. This ensures even batter adherence.
4. Season the shrimp: Add salt, MSG, and pepper to the marinated shrimp and mix well. Marinate for 3 minutes.
5. Prepare the batter: In a bowl, combine ½ egg, soybean oil, and starch. Gradually add water, mixing until a batter consistency is achieved (adjust water amount as needed).  The batter should coat the shrimp evenly.
6. Coat the shrimp: Dip each shrimp into the batter, ensuring they are evenly coated.
7. Fry the shrimp (Three-Fry Method): Fry the shrimp in batches in hot oil for about one minute. This is the "three-fry method," where the shrimp are fried multiple times to achieve maximum crispiness.
8. Drain and serve: Remove the shrimp from the oil and drain on a plate lined with paper towels.  The final product should be golden brown and crispy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside.
